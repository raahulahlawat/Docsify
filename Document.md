 ```
### To add more pages
If you need more pages, you can simply create more markdown files in your docsify directory.  
Example:
In the docsify directory create a file named intro.md:
```
touch introduction.md
```
you can edit the intro.md file by the following command  
```
vim introduction.md
```

# Configuration
Docsify provides various configuration options to customize the appearance and behavior of your documentation. These options are typically set in the index.js file in the docsify directory. Below are some of the commonly used configuration options:
> You can configure Docsify by defining window.$docsify as an object:

## coverPage
You can set a cover page by setting the coverpage to true and creating a _coverpage.md file in your docsify directory.
* Create a "_coverpage.md" file in your docsify directory.
* Add the content of coverpage in Markdown format 
Example
```
<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    coverpage: true
  }
</script>
```
```
<!-- _coverpage.md -->

# docsify <small>3.5</small>

> A magical documentation site generator.

- Simple and lightweight
- No statically built html files
- Multiple themes
```
## sideBar
In Docsify, the sidebar is a navigational menu displayed on the side of your documentation site. It provides links to different sections or pages of your documentation. The sidebar is typically defined in a "_sidebar.md" file in your project.
* Create a "_sidebar.md" file in your docsify directory.
* Add the content of sidebar in Markdown formate  
Example
```
* [Home](/)
* [Introduction](/introduction.md)
* [Installation](/installation.md)
* [Configuration](/configuration.md)
```
The format is [Link Text](/relative/path/to/page.md).
To see the customise sidebar we need to set the loadsidebar to true in our index.html file.
```
<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadSidebar: true
  }
</script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
```
<b>You need to create a .nojekyll in ./docs to prevent GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore.</b>

## name
Website name as it appears in the top of sidebar.
```
window.$docsify = {
  name: 'docsify',
};
```
The name field can also contain custom HTML for easier customization:
```
window.$docsify = {
  name: '<span>docsify</span>',
};
```
## nameLink
The URL that the website name links to.
```
window.$docsify = {
  nameLink: '/',

  // For each route
  nameLink: {
    '/zh-cn/': '#/zh-cn/',
    '/': '#/',
  },
};
```


## Set Page Titles from Sidebar Selection
you can customize the title by specifying a string after the filename in "_sidebar.md"  
Example:  
```
<!-- docsify/_sidebar.md -->
* [Home](/)
* [Introduction](guide.md "Who I am")
``` 
## table of Contents
Table of contents is atomatically generated once we have created the "_sidebar.md but we can costomize table of contents by setting "subMaxLevel".
```<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadSidebar: true,
    subMaxLevel: 2
}
</script>
```
## ignoringSubheaders
If you want to ignore any subheader we can do so by adding <!-- {docsify-ignore} ---> to the subheader
```
# Getting Started

## Header <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
```

This header won't appear in the sidebar table of contents.
## customNavbar
you can create a custom markdown-based navigation file by setting loadNavbar to true and creating "_navbar.md" in your docsify directory
To create the "_navbar.md":
```
cd docsify
touch _navbar.md
```
Edit the _navbar.md as per your requirement For example
```
<!-- _navbar.md -->

* [Hindi](/)
* [English](/En/)
```
To see the changes edit your html file to loadNavbar:true
```
<!-- index.html -->

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadNavbar: true
  }
</script>
```
## nestedNavbar
You can also create a nested navbar by nesting the sub-element under a parent element
```
<!-- _navbar.md -->

* Getting started

  * [Quick start](quickstart.md)
  * [Writing more pages](more-pages.md)
* Configuration
  * [Configuration](configuration.md)
  * [Themes](themes.md)
```
## externalLinkRel

Default 'noopener' (no opener) prevents the newly opened external page (when externalLinkTarget is '_blank') from having the ability to control our page. No rel is set when it's not '_blank'
```
window.$docsify = {
  externalLinkRel: '', // default: 'noopener'
};
```
## externalLinkTarget
Target to open external links inside the markdown. Default '_blank' (new window/tab)

```
window.$docsify = {
  externalLinkTarget: '_self', // default: '_blank'
};
```
## hideSidebar
This option will completely hide your sidebar and won't render any content on the side.
```
window.$docsify = {
  hideSidebar: true,
};
```
## homepage
README.md in your docs folder will be treated as the homepage for your website, but sometimes you may need to serve another file as your homepage.


```
window.$docsify = {
  // Change to /home.md
  homepage: 'home.md',

  // Or use the readme in your repo
  homepage:
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsifyjs/docsify/master/README.md',
};
```
## nativeEmoji
Render emoji shorthand codes using GitHub-style emoji images or platform-native emoji characters.
```
window.$docsify = {
  nativeEmoji: true,
};
```

## repo
Configure the repository url, or a string of username/repo, to add the GitHub Corner widget in the top right corner of the site.
```
window.$docsify = {
  repo: 'docsifyjs/docsify',
  // or
  repo: 'https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/',
};
```
## Search functionality in Docsify.
Enabling the search functionality in Docsify involves configuring the search feature in the index.html file. Here's a step-by-step guide:
```
<!-- index.html -->

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    // Other configuration options...

    // Configure search
    search: {
      maxAge: 86400000, // Expiration time of the search data, default is one day
      paths: 'auto',    // Search all documents by default; you can specify specific paths
      placeholder: 'Type to search',
    },

    // Other configuration options...
  };
</script>

<!-- Include Docsify script -->
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify@4.12.0/dist/docsify.min.js"></script>

```

```
<!-- index.html -->

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadNavbar: true
  }
</script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
```
> Markdown
```
<!-- _navbar.md -->

* [En](/)
* [chinese](/zh-cn/)
```
## List of Plugins
### Full text search
By default, the hyperlink on the current page is recognized and the content is saved in localStorage. You can also specify the path to the files.
```
<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    search: 'auto', // default

    search: [
      '/',            // => /README.md
      '/guide',       // => /guide.md
      '/get-started', // => /get-started.md
      '/zh-cn/',      // => /zh-cn/README.md
    ],

    // complete configuration parameters
    search: {
      maxAge: 86400000, // Expiration time, the default one day
      paths: [], // or 'auto'
      placeholder: 'Type to search',

      // Localization
      placeholder: {
        '/zh-cn/': '搜索',
        '/': 'Type to search',
      },

      noData: 'No Results!',

      // Localization
      noData: {
        '/zh-cn/': '找不到结果',
        '/': 'No Results',
      },

      // Headline depth, 1 - 6
      depth: 2,

      hideOtherSidebarContent: false, // whether or not to hide other sidebar content

      // To avoid search index collision
      // between multiple websites under the same domain
      namespace: 'website-1',

      // Use different indexes for path prefixes (namespaces).
      // NOTE: Only works in 'auto' mode.
      //
      // When initialiazing an index, we look for the first path from the sidebar.
      // If it matches the prefix from the list, we switch to the corresponding index.
      pathNamespaces: ['/zh-cn', '/ru-ru', '/ru-ru/v1'],

      // You can provide a regexp to match prefixes. In this case,
      // the matching substring will be used to identify the index
      pathNamespaces: /^(\/(zh-cn|ru-ru))?(\/(v1|v2))?/,
    },
  };
</script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/search.min.js"></script>
```
### External Script
If the script on the page is an external one (imports a js file via src attribute), you'll need this plugin to make it work.
```
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/external-script.min.js"></script>
```
### Copy to Clipboard
Add a simple Click to copy button to all preformatted code blocks to effortlessly allow users to copy example code from your docs.
```
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify-copy-code/dist/docsify-copy-code.min.js"></script>
```

## Steps for deploying Docsify
Deploying Docsify typically involves hosting your documentation on a web server or a cloud platform. Here are general steps to deploy Docsify:
### 1. Prepare Your Docsify Project:
Ensure that your Docsify project is complete, and you've tested it locally using the Docsify development server. You should have a working index.html file and a directory (e.g., docs) containing your Markdown files.
### 2. Create a Repository:
If your documentation is not already in a Git repository, initialize a new repository:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
### 3. Choose a Deployment Method:
Choose a deployment method based on your preferences and requirements. Common deployment options include:
> #### GitHub Pages:
> Host your Docsify documentation directly on GitHub Pages. Follow the steps mentioned in the previous answer ("How to integrate Docsify with GitHub") for configuring GitHub Pages.

> #### Netlify: 
> If you prefer an easy-to-use platform, Netlify supports static site hosting. Connect your Docsify project to a new site on Netlify and deploy automatically on each push.

> #### Vercel: 
> Similar to Netlify, Vercel provides an easy way to deploy static sites. You can connect your Docsify project to Vercel and deploy your documentation.

> #### Self-Hosted Server: 
> You can deploy Docsify on your own web server. Copy the contents of your Docsify project to your server and configure the server to serve the files.
### 4. Configure Deployment Settings:
Depending on your chosen deployment method, configure any necessary settings. For example:

* If using GitHub Pages, configure the branch and directory in the GitHub repository settings.
* If using Netlify or Vercel, follow the respective platform's deployment configuration steps.
### 5. Deploy:
Trigger the deployment process based on your chosen deployment method:

> #### GitHub Pages: 
>Push your changes to the repository, and GitHub Pages will automatically deploy your Docsify documentation.

> #### Netlify/Vercel: 
> Connect your repository to Netlify or Vercel, configure settings, and trigger a manual deployment or set up automatic deployments on each push.

> #### Self-Hosted Server: 
> Copy the Docsify project files to your server. Use a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to serve the static files. Configure the server to point to the index.html file.
### 6. Verify Deployment:
Visit the URL where your Docsify documentation is deployed and verify that it is accessible and displays correctly.
### 7. Update Documentation:
Whenever you make changes to your Docsify documentation, commit the changes to your repository, and the chosen deployment method will update the deployed site accordingly.

Remember to refer to the documentation of your chosen deployment method for any specific steps or configurations. The deployment process may vary slightly depending on the platform you choose.
